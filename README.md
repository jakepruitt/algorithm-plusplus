algorithm-plusplus
==================

Implementations of classic algorithms in C++. Sister repository to [algorithm-js](https://github.com/jrpruit1/algorithm-js)

Note: I already know that [algorithms](https://github.com/xtaci/algorithms) exists, and I'm not trying to steal from the popularity of that. I will probably be looking to that for guidance. I mostly just want to get better at writing algorithms and data structures in C++, and hopefully this will help.

Feel free to give feedback or make suggestions. I might break this up into a module for every algorithm and data structure, each with their own tests and maybe one day their own repositories. The code will be well commented for you to go through and learn from, so have at it!

If you're interested in neat comparisons between this project and [algorithm-js](https://github.com/jrpruit1/algorithm-js), a JavaScript implementation of the same functions, check out my blog, [JavaScript Jake](http://javascriptjake.com/).
